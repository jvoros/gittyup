Learning git. Like a newbie.

Great resources:

- [Atlassian Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing)
- [git-scm](https://git-scm.com)

## Key Notes to Self

- use `git push -u <remote> <branch-name>` to push a local branch to a remote, then using `git push` will sync those branches from then on.
- `git push -u <remote> HEAD` is a "handy way to push the current branch to the same name on the remote" [source](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push).
- use rebase instead of pull? [Check it out on stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15915430/what-exactly-does-gits-rebase-preserve-merges-do-and-why)
